# Crop_Prediction_Recommendation_system

# Context
Precision agriculture is in trend nowadays.
It helps the farmers to get informed decision about the farming strategy. Here, 
I present you a dataset which would allow the users to build a predictive model to recommend the most suitable crops to grow in a particular farm based on various parameters.

This dataset was build by augmenting datasets of rainfall, climate and fertilizer data available for India.

## Data fields
N - ratio of Nitrogen content in soil

P - ratio of Phosphorous content in soil

K - ratio of Potassium content in soil

temperature - temperature in degree Celsius

humidity - relative humidity in %

ph - ph value of the soil

rainfall - rainfall in mm
